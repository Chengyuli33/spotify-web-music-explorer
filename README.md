# 🎧 Spotify WebDB Application

A full-stack music data exploration platform developed in React + Node.js, integrated with a PostgreSQL RDS backend. This project demonstrates dynamic querying, data visualization, and backend API design. Designed as part of CIS 5500: Database and Information Systems coursework.



## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Database: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
- Frontend: React.js, MUI (Material UI), Recharts
- Backend: Node.js + Express, REST API with route handlers
- Visualization: Recharts (RadarChart, BarChart)
- Dev Tools: VS Code, Git, Chrome DevTools, DataGrip, npm


## 📂 Project Structure

This project contains separate folders for the backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL) and frontend (React + MUI), each with its own documentation:

- [`server/`](./server) – Node.js + Express backend with API routes and PostgreSQL. 👉 [Backend README](./server/README.md)

- [`client/`](./client) – React frontend with MUI components and dynamic visualizations. 👉 [Frontend README](./client/README.md)

- [`data/`](./data) – Source CSV files used to populate the database. 👉 [Dataset Description](./data/README.md)



## ✨ Features

- [`server/`](./server) â€“ Node.js + Express backend with API routes and PostgreSQL  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Backend README](./server/README.md)

- [`client/`](./client) â€“ React frontend with MUI components and dynamic visualizations  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Frontend README](./client/README.md)

- [`data/`](./data) â€“ Source CSV files used to populate the database  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Dataset Description](./data/README.md)
